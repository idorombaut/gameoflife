# gameoflife

A simple Java implementation of the Game of Life.

## Game of Life Explanation

It is a cellular automaton, and was devised by Cambridge mathematician John Conway. Initially, there is a grid with some cells which may be alive or dead. Depending on the initial conditions, the cells form various patterns throughout the course of the game. Conway's Game of Life has four rules:
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by solitude.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
